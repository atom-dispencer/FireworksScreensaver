A screensaver for Windows which makes pretty fireworks 😊🎆

## Usage

1) Grab `Fireworks.scr` from the Releases page (or build it yourself).
2) Place `Fireworks.scr` in your `System32` (e.g. `C:/Windows/System32/`).
3) Select `Fireworks` in the Control Panel (Just search `screensaver` 
   or `change screen saver` or something like that in your search bar or 
   start menu).

I suggest turning the wait down as low as possible so you get to see the
   fireworks most often!
