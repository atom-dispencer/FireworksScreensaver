A screensaver for Windows which makes pretty fireworks 😊🎆

This was somewhat inspired by a [Dave's Garage video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-foAV_zU2as)
   about making a Matrix-style screensaver for the PDP-11/83.

## Usage

1) Grab `Fireworks.scr` from the Releases page (or build it yourself).
2) Place `Fireworks.scr` in your `System32` (e.g. `C:/Windows/System32/`).
3) Select `Fireworks` in the Control Panel (Just search `screensaver` 
   or `change screen saver` or something like that in your search bar or 
   start menu).

I suggest turning the wait down as low as possible so you get to see the
   fireworks most often!

The screensaver automatically closes when you click any button, but *not*
   if you just move the mouse because I personally find that annoying.
